# servos-arduino-sensors-sculpture
An Arduino project that controls four servos using a smooth sine wave motion, triggered by a PIR sensor. The servos alternate between two movement configurations every 10 seconds and stop 10 seconds after no motion is detected. Features gradual transitions, customizable speed/angles, and efficient motion-based activation.
